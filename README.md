Analysis of Hash Table

This code is an analysis of a hashtable using linked lists that store strings and integers. The lists are separated in different classes to clearly differentiate them rather than using templates. The linked lists are inserted to arrays and random values are generated and hashed to put into the linked lists. The time it takes to insert, print, search for and delete are determined for both lists.
